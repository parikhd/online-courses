Arrays:

Always fixed lengt and size
When we declare array of objects (eg String) they store the reference to the mem loc where object is stored, hence
size is always fixed.

Retrieval is always O(1) no matter what size
Reason: multiply index with size, add it to base address, go to that loc and fetch item
eg. a[0] = 100 + (0*4) = 100; a[2] = 100 + (2*4) = 108

Retrieval without index is always O(n).
